## S03: Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)

#### Summary

- **EC2 Instance**: AMI (OS) + Instance Size (CPU + RAM) + Stoarge + Security Groups + EC2 User Data
- **Security Groups**: Firewall attached to the EC2 instance
- **EC2 User Data**: Script launched at the first start of an instance
- **SSH**: start a terminal into our EC2 instances (port 22)
- **EC2 Instance Role**: link to IAM roles
- **Purchasing Options**: On-Demand, Spot, Reserved (Standard + Convertible + Scheduled), Dedicated Host, Dedicated Instance



- EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud = IaaS
- Capabilities
  - Renting virtual machines (EC2)
  - Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
  - Distributing load across machines (ELB)
  - Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)



#### Sizing + Configuration Options

- **Operating System (OS)**: Linux, Windows, Mac OS
- **Compute power + cores (CPU)**
- **Random-access memory (RAM)**
- How much storage space
  - Network-attached (EBS & EFS)
  - hardware (EC2 Instance Store)
- **Network card**: speed of the card, Public IP address
- **Firewall rules**: security group
- Bootstrap script (configure at first launch): EC2 **User Data Script**
  - Script is only run once at the instance first start
    - Install updates
    - Install software
    - Downloading common files from the internet
  - EC2 User Data Script is run by the root user



Terminating vs Stopping

- EBS data will be deleted on termination



#### EC2 Instance Types

e.g. m5.2xlarge

- m: instance class
- 5: generation (Improves over time)
- 2xlarge: size within the instance class

**Types**

- **General Purpose**
  - Diversity of workloads such as web servers + code repos
  - Balance between Compute + Memory + Networking
  - e.g. t2.micro
- **Compute Optimized**
  - Compute-intensive tasks that require high performance processors
    - Batch processing workloads
    - Media transcoding
    - High performance web servers
    - High performance computing (HPC)
    - Scientific modelling & machine learning
    - Gaming servers
  - e.g. c6g, C5 (all start with C)
- **Memory Optimized**
  - For workloads that process large data sets in memory (RAM)
    - Relational/non-relational databases
    - Distributed cache stores
    - In-memory databases optimized for BI
    - Applications performing real-time processing of big unstructured data
  - e.g. R6g, R (starts with R for RAM) + X1, z1d
- **Accelerated Computing**
- **Storage Optimized**
  - Storage-intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write access to large data sets on local storage
    - Relational & NoSQL databases
    - Cache for in-memory databases (e.g. Redis)
    - Data warehousing applications
    - Distributed file systems
  - e.g. I3, D2



#### Security Groups

- Fundamental network security
- Control how traffic is allowed into or out of EC2 instances
- Security groups only contain allow rules
- Can reference by IP or Security group
- "firewall" on EC2 instances
- Regulate
  - Access to ports
  - Authorized IP ranges (IPv4 + IPv6)
  - Control inbound network 
  - Control of outbound network
- Can be attached to multiple instances & instances can have multiple SGs
- Locked down to a region / VPC combination
- Lives outside the EC2 - if traffic is blocked EC2 won't see it
- Good to maintain one separate security group for SSH access

- Inbound traffic is blocked by default, and all outbound is authorized by default

**Good to Know**

If application is not accessible (time out) then it's a security group issue

If application gives "connection refused" error, then it's an application error or not launched



Referencing other security groups from other security groups

- Allows attached security group to an instance to pass through



#### Classic Ports

- 22 = SSH (Secure Shell) - log into a Linux instance
- 21 = FTP (File Transfer Protocol) - upload files into a file share
- 22 = SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) - upload files using SSH
- 80 = HTTP - access unsecured websites
- 443 = HTTPS - access secured websites
- 3389 = RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) - log into a Windows Instance



EC2 Instance Connect only works with Amazon Linux Image; 

SSH on Mac/Linux + Windows >= 10

- Permissions 0644 is too open
- chmod 0400 <key name> fixes the issue

Putty on Windows



#### EC2 Instances Purchasing Options

- **On-Demand Instances: short workload, predictable pricing**

  - Pay for what you use
    - Linux - Billing per second, after the first minute
    - All other OS: billing per hour
  - Has the highest cost, but no upfront payment
  - No long-term commitment

- **Reserved (min 1 year)**

  - Reserved Instances: long workloads
    - Up to 75% discount compared to On-Demand
    - Reservation period: 1 year = + discount | 3 years = +++ discount
    - Purchasing options: no upfront | partial upfront= + | All upfront = ++discount
    - Reserve a specific instance type
    - Steady-state usage applications (like database)
  - Convertible Reserved Instances: long workloads with flexible instances
    - Can change the EC2 instance type
    - Up to 54% discount
  - Scheduled Reserved Instances: example - every Thursday between 3 and 6
    - Launch within time window you reserve
    - When you require only a fraction of day/week/month
    - Commitment for 1 to 3 years

- **Spot Instances: short workloads, cheap, can lose instances (less reliable)**

  - Up to 90% discount compared to On-Demand
  - Instances that you can "lose" at any point of time
    - Max price is less that the current spot price
  - MOST cost-efficient
  - Workload must be resilient to failure
    - Batch jobs
    - Data analysis
    - Image processing
    - Any distributed workloads
    - Workloads with flexible start and end time
  - Not suitable for critical jobs or databases!!!

- **Dedicated Hosts: book an entire physical server, control instance placement**

  - A physical server with EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated to your use.
  -  Addresses **compliance requirements** and reduce costs by allowing you to use your **existing server-bound software licenses**
  - Allocated for your account for a 3-year period reservation
  - More expensive
  - Useful for software that have complicated licensing model (BYOL) or companies w strong regulatory or compliance needs
  - Dedicated Instances
    - Instances running on hardware that's dedicated to you
    - May share hardware with other instances in same account
    - No control over instance placement (can move hardware after stop/start)
    - Lighter version of Dedicated hosts (not much hardware access)

  

  ##### Select Purchasing Option (hotel analogy)

  - On Demand: coming and staying whenever, pay the full price for room
  - Reserved: planning ahead, plan on staying for a long time, get a good discount
  - Spot instances: allows people to bid for empty rooms and the highest bidder keeps the rooms. Can get kicked out at any time
  - Dedicated hosts: book an entire building of the resort

  

  **Pricing Example (m4.large - us-east-1)**

  On-Demand = Dedicated Host > Reserved Scheduled > Reserved Convertible > Reserved Instance > Dedicated Host Reservation > Spot 



#### Shared Responsibility Model for EC2

- AWS
  - Infrastructure (global network security)
  - Isolation on physical hosts
  - Replacing faulty hardware
  - Compliance validation (regulations that they have agreed to)
- You
  - Security Groups rules
  - Operating-system patches and updates
  - Software and utilities installed on the EC2 instances
  - IAM Roles assigned to EC2 & IAM user access management
  - Data security on your instance
